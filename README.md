# Pathfinding Algorithms
 This repository contains visualizations of several pathfinding algorithms.

# Requirements
 Installed python3 and pygame library for creating visualization
 ```python
 pip install pygame
 ```
 
 # Usage
  First of all, go to the 'config.py' file and set some constant values for yourself :
  
  ```python
  #config.py 
  
  #Here you must set some configs
  CELL_SIZE   =  None # -> 10
  WINDOW_SIZE =  None # -> (500,500)
  ```
